# Rails/Heroku Test Application
This is an exercise in deploying sites using Rails and Heroku. This application queries the user for a car make, model, and year then adds it to a list of cars. The list conforms to the constraints of REST architectural style and allows updating, deleting, etc. There is no CSS styling applied beyond basics; this is just a test. The application is deployed via Heroku at: https://cryptic-tundra-22949.herokuapp.com/.
